<div class="faq-question" tabindex="-1">I’ve completed the Bridge VR Setup, and I’m still not getting a clear image of my hands.</div>
<div class="faq-answer" tabindex="-1">As far as possible, we recommend using Bridge in uniform lighting conditions. We advise against harsh lights or light at unusual angles, as reflections and glare negatively affect the experience. From our research, when used in ideal lighting conditions, there should always be a clear hand image, but in non-ideal lighting conditions, a low contrast between keyboard color and hand skin tone can result in a poor experience. We are aware of this, and it’s the primary issue that we are working to solve today: experimenting with different lighting, differently colored keyboards (we’ve been experimenting with blue prototype G810s!), matt finishes and more.</div>

<div class="faq-question" tabindex="-1">I can see colored dots (‘noise’), the same color as my virtual hands, on my virtual keyboard.</div>
<div class="faq-answer" tabindex="-1">This can happen as we use luminance and color space to filter your real hands as separate from your real keyboard. Adjust the Hand Visibility slider in Settings.</div>

<div class="faq-question" tabindex="-1">My hands are not aligned with the virtual keyboard.</div>
<div class="faq-answer" tabindex="-1">On your Bridge VR keyboard, hold the ALIGN key to bring you into Alignment mode. The goal is to use your mouse to align your real keyboard, viewed through the camera-feed, with the blue key outlines. For more information, check out the Controls section of the Settings tab.</div>

<div class="faq-question" tabindex="-1">My keyboard “swims” - what can I do?</div>
<div class="faq-answer" tabindex="-1">When you move your head, the keyboard and hands may appear to swim or move in front of you in the virtual space. This is due to a delay between the acquisition of the pose of the keyboard from the tracker and the rendering of both layers (keyboard and hands) in our engine. We realise it can be somewhat disconcerting for some people, and we’re working on improving this for the next release.</div>
